## 🌐 Understanding Quaternions for Space Navigation

Quaternions are fundamental to our robot's movement system, providing mathematically robust 3D rotation without gimbal lock:

**Why Quaternions for Space Robotics?**
- **No Gimbal Lock**: Unlike Euler angles, quaternions avoid mathematical singularities
- **Smooth Interpolation**: Essential for precise movement in microgravity
- **Compact Representation**: 4 values (w, x, y, z) represent any 3D rotation
- **Stable Computation**: Numerically stable for continuous robot control

## 🔧 Hardware Specifications

The Astrobee robot operates on resource-constrained hardware in the ISS:
- **High-Level Processor (HLP)**: Intel Atom x5-E3940
- **Operating Environment**: Microgravity, limited computational resources

## 🎯 Running the Simulator

### Launch the Astrobee Simulator

1. **Start the simulation environment**:
```bash
roslaunch astrobee sim.launch dds:=false robot:=sim_pub rviz:=true
```

2. **For visual representation** (resource-intensive):
```bash
roslaunch astrobee sim.launch dds:=false robot:=sim_pub rviz:=true sviz:=true
```

3. **Deploy your APK** to the simulated Astrobee robot through the Ground Data System (GDS)

## 🤖 Machine Learning Pipeline

### Model Training

The TensorFlow model for tool detection is trained using our Kaggle notebook:

**Training Notebook**: [6th KRPC Training with Background](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zer0abd/6th-krpc-training-with-bg)

This notebook includes:
- Synthetic data generation for 8 different tools
- Data augmentation techniques
- Model architecture optimization for embedded deployment

### Model Conversion

Convert the trained model for deployment using our conversion notebook:

**Conversion Notebook**: [Conversion Test](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zer0abd/conversion-test)

The conversion process:
1. Exports the trained TensorFlow model
2. Converts to TensorFlow Lite format
3. Applies quantization for reduced model size
4. Optimizes for Intel Atom x5-E3940 processor

### Optimization for Astrobee's Processor

Given the **Intel Atom x5-E3940** processor constraints:

1. **TensorFlow Lite Integration**:
   - Model quantization reduces size by ~75%
   - INT8 quantization for faster inference
   - Optimized for x86 architecture

2. **OpenCV Optimization**:
   - Hardware-accelerated functions
   - Memory-efficient image processing
   - Reduced computational complexity

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Asynchronous processing for real-time performance
   - Memory pooling to prevent allocation overhead
   - Efficient quaternion calculations for movement
